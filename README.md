# Renatus Kosmos
TO INSTALL PROPERLY
This mod requires a small amount of manual installation.

First, if not there already, move the mod folder "RenatusKosmos" into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terra Invicta\Mods\Enabled

You must now cut and paste (Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V) the contents of the "OVERWRITE" folder into each correct TerraInvicta_Data subfolder, replacing the originals
- Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Terra Invicta\TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets
- Herein, cut and paste the files with each subfolder of "OVERWRITE" into their respective folders in TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets. 
 
 IE: 
 - All files in the OVERWRITE\AssetBundles folder to the TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets\AssetBundles
 - All files in the OVERWRITE\Templates folder to the TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets\Templates
 - All files in the OVERWRITE\Localization\en folder to the TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets\Localization\en
 
TO UNINSTALL
 - delete the Templates, Localization\en, and AssetBundles folders
 - Steam-> right-click Terra Invicta -> Properties -> Local Files -> Verify Integrity of Game Files...

Must have UnityModManager installed (included, but also available https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)
- Open UnityModManager executable inside the UnityModManager folder
- Select Terra Invicta from the list. If game folder is not automatically detected, select it yourself (e.g. \Steam\steamapps\common\YourGame\)
- Select installation method: DoorstopProxy
- Click on the install button
- Ensure that the mod is "enabled" on load through the UnityModManager menu.

That's it, you're done. 

Because you copied over the files and installed UMM, you do not need to check the "use mods" button. If you did not delete the files in "OVERWRITE" after copying them over, do not check the "use mods" button.

Some, if not all achievements still work. Use the Enable Achievements mod to get full functionality.
